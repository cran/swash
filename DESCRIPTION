Description: The Swash-Backwash Model for the Single Epidemic Wave was developed by Cliff and Haggett (2006) <doi:10.1007/s10109-006-0027-8> to model the velocity of spread of infectious diseases across space. This package enables the calculation of the Swash-Backwash Model for user-supplied panel data on regional infections. The package also provides additional functions for bootstrap confidence intervals, country comparison, visualization of results, and data management.
